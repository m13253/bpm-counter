Copy the bpm-counter.py in some DIRECTORY, open a terminal and change to it ($ is the command prompt on my Linux system):

 {{{$ cd DIRECTORY}}}

and either call the python interpreter with your file as argument (and submitting the input with the return key)

 {{{$ python bpm-counter.py}}}

*or*: First make the file executable

 {{{$ chmod +x bpm-counter.py}}}

and then you are able to execute the code directly:

 {{{$ ./bpm-counter.py}}}
